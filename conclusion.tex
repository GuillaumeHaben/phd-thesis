\section{Perspectives}

%Thus, in our short-term future work, we plan to (1) experiment HPath with more application by extending the support of Mercator to other languages implementing the Selenium API, (2) explore more opportunities to generate good predicates relying on heuristics present in the HTML documents such as section titles, overlays, etc. (3) explore ways to generate a rendering tree closer to the GUI components displayed on the screen to better abstract away structural details of the DOM.
