\chapter{Evolution of System User Interactive Tests}

\chapterPage{
The evolution of SUITs is only scarcely covered in the existing literature, most previous studies on test code evolution focusing on unit tests. However, SUITs present peculiarities that might affect their evolution, especially when considering the fragility problem. In this chapter presents an industrial case study on the
evolution of  Keyword-Driven test suites. Our aim is to demonstrate the problem of SUIT test maintenance, identify the benefits of Keyword-Driven Testing and overall improve the understanding of SUIT test code evolution.
