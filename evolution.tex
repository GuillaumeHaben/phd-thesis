\chapter{Evolution of System User Interactive Tests}
\label{chap:evolution-system-user-interactive-test}

\chapterPage{
The evolution of \gls{suit}s is only scarcely covered in the existing literature, most previous studies on test code evolution focusing on unit tests. However, \gls{suit}s present peculiarities that might affect their evolution, especially when considering the fragility problem. In this chapter presents an industrial case study on the evolution of  \gls{kdt} suites. Our aim is to demonstrate the problem of \gls{suit} maintenance, identify the benefits of \gls{kdt} and overall improve the understanding of \gls{suit} evolution.
