\tool\ is a static analysis tool for continuous inspection of \gls{kdt} written using the Robot Framework syntax. We present the tool and the way it can be used to increase the quality of \gls{kdt} code base. Then, we present a case study conducted at \BGL\ where the tool is introduced and used by \gls{qa} automation engineers since 2019.
