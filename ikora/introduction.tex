\section{Introduction}

This chapter presents \tool, a tool that aims at filling this gap. It inspects test code developed using Robot Framework~\cite{RobotFramework2020}. More precisely, \tool~aims at tackling the lack of static analysis tooling for \gls{kdt} test suites that automation testers at \BGL, and at other companies, face. In Chapter~\ref{chap:evolution-system-user-interactive-test}, we analyze the evolution of such test suites and identify several challenges that impact test maintenance. Specifically, as the \gls{kdt} test suites evolve, they become a complex software artifact, suffering from the same problems as typical codebases do, \eg\ the presence of code duplication and dead code. \tool~addresses such challenges by continuously analyzing the test code for test smells and reporting \gls{kpi} about the project back to the testers.
