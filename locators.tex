\chapter{Towards Robust Locators}
\label{chap:robust-locators}

\chapterPage{
When targeting web front end, test scripts rely often on \gls{dom}-based locators to identify elements in the web page to interact with. Introducing cosmetic or non-functional changes may break the locator, and consequently the test scripts depending on it. In this chapter we present HPath, a new technique to generate \gls{dom}-based locators exploiting the rendering engine to remove the reliance on internal structural details of the \gls{dom}, thus, generating locators more robust against \gls{sut} evolution.
