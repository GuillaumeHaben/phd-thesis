\textit{
In this chapter, we perform a replication of the vocabulary-based approach, one of the main techniques used to detect flaky tests. With this study, we intend to bring three contributions. First, we evaluate the approach under more realistic settings. Second, we check the generalisability of the approach by checking its application to another programming language. Finally, we experiment using an extended set of features in an attempt to improve the original approach.} \\
