\chapter{Pinpointing Classes Responsible for Test Flakiness}

\justifying
\textit{Still with the goal of helping to debug flakiness, we present in this chapter a new approach to locate the source of flakiness when it originates from the code under test. This represents a specific but critical case as the cause of non-determinism lies in the program itself. The approach leverages Spectrum-Based Fault Localisation techniques, code and change metrics and ensemble learning to rank classes the most likely to be responsible for flakiness.\\
