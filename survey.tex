\textit{At the time of writing, flakiness research was still in its early stages. Therefore, in this chapter, we answer the need for a better understanding of the problem by conducting a qualitative study. We interviewed practitioners and report their perception of the sources and impacts of flakiness as well as the mitigation strategies they have in place to tackle the problem. We also identify automation opportunities paving the way for future research works.} \\
